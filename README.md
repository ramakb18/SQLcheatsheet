## SQL Commands Overview

SQL commands are categorized into several sublanguages to manage databases effectively:

- **DDL** (Data Definition Language): Defines and manages the database structure.
- **DQL** (Data Query Language): Retrieves data from the database.
- **DML** (Data Manipulation Language): Manipulates data within the database.
- **DCL** (Data Control Language): Controls access and permissions.
- **TCL** (Transaction Control Language): Manages transactions.

---

## Data Definition Language (DDL)

DDL is used to define and modify database structures.

### Common DDL Commands:
- `CREATE TABLE`: Creates a new table in the database.
- `ALTER TABLE`: Modifies an existing table.
- `DROP TABLE`: Deletes a table from the database.
- `CREATE DATABASE`: Creates a new database.
- `DROP DATABASE`: Deletes a database.
- `CREATE INDEX`: Creates an index on a table.
- `DROP INDEX`: Deletes an index.

#### Example of DDL:
```sql
CREATE TABLE employees (
    employee_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    first_name VARCHAR(50),
    last_name VARCHAR(50),
    hire_date DATE
);

ALTER TABLE employees ADD COLUMN department VARCHAR(50);
DROP TABLE employees;
```

---

## Data Query Language (DQL)

DQL is used for querying and retrieving data from the database.

### Common DQL Command:
- `SELECT`: Retrieves data from one or more tables.

#### Example of DQL:
```sql
SELECT first_name, last_name, hire_date
FROM employees
WHERE department = 'Sales'
ORDER BY hire_date DESC;
```

---

## Data Manipulation Language (DML)

DML is used to manipulate the data in the database.

### Common DML Commands:
- `INSERT`: Adds new records to a table.
- `UPDATE`: Modifies existing records.
- `DELETE`: Removes records from a table.

#### Example of DML:
```sql
INSERT INTO employees (first_name, last_name, department)
VALUES ('John', 'Doe', 'Marketing');

UPDATE employees
SET department = 'Sales'
WHERE employee_id = 1;

DELETE FROM employees WHERE employee_id = 5;
```

---

## Data Control Language (DCL)

DCL is used to manage access permissions and controls.

### Common DCL Commands:
- `GRANT`: Gives a user permission to perform actions.
- `REVOKE`: Removes a user's permissions.

#### Example of DCL:
```sql
GRANT SELECT, INSERT ON employees TO user_name;

REVOKE DELETE ON employees FROM user_name;
```

---

## Transaction Control Language (TCL)

TCL is used to manage transactions in a database.

### Common TCL Commands:
- `COMMIT`: Saves the changes made in the current transaction.
- `ROLLBACK`: Undoes the changes made in the current transaction.
- `SAVEPOINT`: Sets a point in the transaction to which you can roll back.

#### Example of TCL:
```sql
BEGIN TRANSACTION;
UPDATE employees SET department = 'HR' WHERE employee_id = 1;
SAVEPOINT savepoint1;
UPDATE employees SET department = 'Sales' WHERE employee_id = 2;
ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT savepoint1;
COMMIT;
```

---

## Important SQL Clauses

### `WHERE` Clause:
Filters rows based on a specified condition.

```sql
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE department = 'Sales';
```

### `ORDER BY` Clause:
Sorts the result set in ascending or descending order.

```sql
SELECT * FROM employees ORDER BY hire_date DESC;
```

### `GROUP BY` Clause:
Groups rows that have the same values into summary rows.

```sql
SELECT department, COUNT(*) AS num_employees
FROM employees
GROUP BY department;
```

### `HAVING` Clause:
Filters records after the `GROUP BY` clause is applied.

```sql
SELECT department, COUNT(*) AS num_employees
FROM employees
GROUP BY department
HAVING COUNT(*) > 5;
```

### `DISTINCT` Clause:
Removes duplicate records from the result set.

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT department FROM employees;
```

## SQL Operators

### Comparison Operators:
- `=`: Equal
- `!=` or `<>`: Not equal
- `>`: Greater than
- `<`: Less than
- `>=`: Greater than or equal
- `<=`: Less than or equal
- `BETWEEN`: Between a range
- `IN`: Matches any value in a list
- `LIKE`: Matches a pattern

### Logical Operators:
- `AND`: Combines multiple conditions.
- `OR`: Matches any condition.
- `NOT`: Negates a condition.

### Set Operators:
- `UNION`: Combines results from two or more SELECT queries.
- `INTERSECT`: Returns only the common records from two SELECT queries.
- `EXCEPT`: Returns records from the first query that are not in the second query.

---

## SQL Functions

### Aggregate Functions:
- `COUNT()`: Counts the number of rows.
- `SUM()`: Calculates the sum of a column.
- `AVG()`: Calculates the average of a column.
- `MIN()`: Finds the minimum value in a column.
- `MAX()`: Finds the maximum value in a column.

### String Functions:
- `CONCAT()`: Combines two or more strings.
- `UPPER()`: Converts a string to uppercase.
- `LOWER()`: Converts a string to lowercase.
- `LENGTH()`: Returns the length of a string.

### Date Functions:
- `NOW()`: Returns the current date and time.
- `CURDATE()`: Returns the current date.
- `DATEADD()`: Adds a specified interval to a date.
- `DATEDIFF()`: Returns the difference between two dates.

---

## SQL Joins

### INNER JOIN:
Returns records with matching values in both tables.

```sql
SELECT * FROM employees
INNER JOIN departments ON employees.department_id = departments.department_id;
```

### LEFT JOIN (or LEFT OUTER JOIN):
Returns all records from the left table, and matched records from the right table.

```sql
SELECT * FROM employees
LEFT JOIN departments ON employees.department_id = departments.department_id;
```

### RIGHT JOIN (or RIGHT OUTER JOIN):
Returns all records from the right table, and matched records from the left table.

```sql
SELECT * FROM employees
RIGHT JOIN departments ON employees.department_id = departments.department_id;
```

### FULL JOIN (or FULL OUTER JOIN):
Returns records when there is a match in one of the tables.

```sql
SELECT * FROM employees
FULL JOIN departments ON employees.department_id = departments.department_id;
```

### CROSS JOIN:
Returns the Cartesian product of the two tables.

```sql
SELECT * FROM employees
CROSS JOIN departments;
```

---

## SQL Constraints

Constraints are used to enforce the rules on data in a table.

- `PRIMARY KEY`: Ensures unique values and not NULL.
- `FOREIGN KEY`: Ensures a column value matches a value in another table.
- `NOT NULL`: Ensures a column cannot have NULL values.
- `UNIQUE`: Ensures all values in a column are unique.
- `CHECK`: Ensures values meet a specified condition.
- `DEFAULT`: Provides a default value for a column when none is specified.

---

## SQL Subqueries

A subquery is a query nested inside another query.

### Example of Subquery:
```sql
SELECT * FROM employees
WHERE department_id = (SELECT department_id FROM departments WHERE department_name = 'Sales');
```

---

## SQL Views

A view is a virtual table created by a query. It simplifies complex queries and can be used for data security.

### Create View:
```sql
CREATE VIEW employee_view AS
SELECT first_name, last_name, department
FROM employees;
```

### Drop View:
```sql
DROP VIEW employee_view;
```

---

## SQL Indexes

Indexes improve the speed of data retrieval operations.

### Create Index:
```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_employee_name ON employees (first_name, last_name);
```

### Drop Index:
```sql
DROP INDEX idx_employee_name;
```

## FAQs

### What are the 5 basic SQL commands?
The five basic SQL commands are:
- `SELECT`: Retrieve data.
- `INSERT`: Add data.
- `UPDATE`: Modify data.
- `DELETE`: Remove data.
- `CREATE`: Define database structures.

### What are the 4 types of SQL commands?
The four types of SQL commands are:
- **DDL**: Data Definition Language (e.g., `CREATE`, `ALTER`, `DROP`).
- **DML**: Data Manipulation Language (e.g., `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`).
- **DCL**: Data Control Language (e.g., `GRANT`, `REVOKE`).
- **TCL**: Transaction Control Language (e.g., `COMMIT`, `ROLLBACK`).

### What is the difference between `INNER JOIN` and `LEFT JOIN`?
- `INNER JOIN` returns only matching rows from both tables.
- `LEFT JOIN` returns all rows from the left table and matching rows from the right table.
